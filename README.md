RSA Factoring Challenge
=======================

Tasks:

0. Factorize all the things!

Factorize as many numbers as possible into a product of two smaller numbers.

1. RSA Factoring Challenge

RSA Laboratories states that: for each RSA number n, there exist prime numbers p and q such that

n = p Ã— q. The problem is to find these two primes, given only n.

This task is the same as task 0, except:

p and q are always prime numbers
There is only one number in the files
